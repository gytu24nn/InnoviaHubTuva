## üë• Team
InnoviaHub is developed by:

**Group:** Hub4

**Group members:**
- Tuva Gyllensten
- Christoffer Kjellgren
- Linus Hallerstr√∂m
- Villiam Damstr√∂m

## ‚ú® Individual Core Development (Tuva Gyllensten)
The following functionality was developed and implemented individually by me, **Tuva Gyllensten**:

- **SmartTips:** AI service where the user gets suggestions for optimal booking times. This function is added on the booking page where the user enters a time for booking. This function can help the user book a time when its less crouded if they want to.

- **IoT-sensorer:** I added IoT-sensorer thats fetched in from its own backend repository. I added a menu option where both admin and users can go in and see the sensors measurement value and on home page i added a summary of the sensor where the users can see if they are inactive or active and how many sensors the company have. See the forked [IoT-sensor](https://github.com/gytu24nn/innovia-iot-tuva) for details.
